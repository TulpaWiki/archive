====== Building a memory house (1960's technique) ======
Here's a description of building a memory house (taken from the shout box as a reference for the future). Note: Updated as requested.\\ 
2nd Edit: This method, taught in the 1960's, is based on the even older Roman Method: http://www.buildyourmemory.com/roman.php

O.k. Here's an exercise.\\ 
It's called a memory house.

Imagine a house\\ 
Imagine you are in a room in the house.\\ 
Now imagine some furniture, some pictures on the wall, a set of sliding drawers\\ 
Now take something you want to remember, make a little trinket of it in your mind\\ 
Now put that trinket in a drawer\\ 
From now, on anytime you want that memory back, you just go into the house, go into the room, open the drawer, and there it is.

Sometimes the furniture in a room will move between visits\\ 
Don't worry about this it just means your subconscious has made a conclusion and has left you a sign that it is ready\\ 
(It may feel a little spooky the first time you see it though)\\ 
It's basically a "you got mail" from your subconscious

Chill, hag out and just get comfortable in your memory house\\ 
It's a useful tool for remembering a thing you want to keep

Will that do for an example?\\ 
This is a Concentration technique from the '60's\\ 
It is a safe technique, unlike hypnotizing yourself

There is no hurry.\\ 
Memory houses can be built slow or fast.\\ 
They are enduring.

===== Optional =====
Create a room for your tulpa\\ 
Put furnishings in it\\ 
(Add some fluffy pillows and cushions if you think appropriate)\\ 
Now your tupla can put things in this room if they want to give them to you\\ 
They can put memories, objects, anything they want in there\\ 
Visit the room occasionally to see what they have left\\ 
If there are feathers everywhere then they have been pillow-fighting\\ 
Over time create more rooms , as many as you want

If you want, let your tulpa in the other rooms you made. they will probably enjoy that - it can be a lot of fun

One thing I noticed was Memphis tends to recede and become inactive when I'm out and about during the day. That's a lot of time I can be narrating and we can be spending together.

A friend mentioned he put a picture of his tulpa as his background on his phone so whenever he checked the time he would think about his tulpa and it would float to the top of his mind. I don't really carry my phone with me, so I came up with an alternative, indiscreet solution:

Tulpabracelets.

The construction is simple:

1. Find/buy an old watch, which suits your taste.

2. Draw some symbol to represent your tulpa.

3. Cut out and laminate the symbol so it will be preserved.

4. Glue the laminated symbol to the watch.


This is the one I made:

It works really well. Memphis stays awake throughout the day when I wear it and we've been able to spend a lot more time together. No one asks about it and it's comfortable.

The only downside is, at least for me, having Memphis active all the time can be exhausting.

Personally I think I'd do better with the phone method because it wouldn't be so tiring because it wouldn't be in my face all the time, but the tulpabracelet method is nice, too.

 I noticed that I sometimes obviously puppeted my tulpa, when I made them move exactly like I moved myself. It seems that I had some trouble getting into parallel processing, not just in terms of audibility.

Just like some audio guides recommend practising overlapping voice (making your tulpa say a different thing while you say another) to help with audibility, I found it useful to do the same with puppeting, and I'm giving a few examples of such symbolics.

Get your tulpa's face really close to your own and breath through your mouth. Tell your tulpa that whenever you breath out, they breath in and vice versa. This will help you to break the mirroring habit and get used to your tulpa doing different things.

If this seems too easy, do the same but at the same time imagine that there's two tubes next to your heads and there is a ball in each of the tube; every time you breath out, the ball in the right tube rises and when you breath in, it goes down. It's the same for your tulpa except in the left tube, now try to imagine all the sensations with the breathing and at the same time get the balls right.

At first I had some trouble doing multiple things at the same time like this, but over time it got better and it helped my tulpa to learn to move on her own after I had trained movement overlapping like this.

[[https://community.tulpa.info/thread-forcing-generally-helpful-forcing-technique-but-mostly-for-visualisation-and-imposition| Generally helpful forcing technique (but mostly for Visualisation and Imposition) ]]

(This technique was originally developed by Chess)

You sit down with your tulpa somewhere in a comfortable place and position, with your tulpa sitting only a short distance away from you (you should probably be as close to each other as you are comfortable being). You want your tulpa to sit in a position that allows it to look straight into your eyes, also if possible your tulpa should have its hands/hooves/paws/etc. on your head.

From your point of view the forcing will go as it usually goes, but your tulpa will have to concentrate on you and will be trying to keep away any thoughts that don't have anything to do with tulpaforcing. How will your tulpa keep the thoughts away? They can shake your head, tell you your thoughts are drifting away, give you some emotional response, head pressure or just simply think them away etc. (Choose whichever works best for you)

This might seem like just an unnecessary technique, that won't have any significant effects, but it does work very well and helps you concentrate on whatever you are doing. If you don't believe me, then read the reports in this thread of people that tried it.

Hey! If you're like me and have difficulty maintaining a visual during a forcing session then I have a few tips for ya.

The idea of this method is to incorporate more senses by replacing your real eyes with the use of your minds eye and acting through your physical self to control your astral self in the WL(Wonderland).
Example: Find a dark room or use a blindfold. Sit or stand, whichever is more comfortable. Understand that if you sit in reality you must also sit in the WL (it helps). Assuming you're sitting, imagine you're sitting on a chair in the centre of a white room. Look down and see your knees, bring your hands up, cover your face, feel the sensations. Remember you are acting with your real body and imagining yourself doing the exact same thing in the WL. I may be explaining this wrong, but simply you are combining the two worlds. I found using this method to greatly improve focus and visualizing my WL as a whole.


Secondly, and personally I like to daydream, especially when I'm going to sleep or napping. I usually create a world where I'm some kind of Warrior or Mage in a fantasy world. What you imagine is up to you, but you want to make this into a game for you and your tulpa, kind of like roleplaying. So imagine this stuff as you normally would but invite your Tulpa along, they might wanna be an Archer or a Mage or something different than you. I guess it becomes like a game. We have fun when we do this and it's also a great forcing session. Try it sometime!


If you have problems understanding these methods let me know, I will attempt to elaborate. Thank you! Big Grin

Helixileh

This is a logic game, and the rules are simple. It can be played with an infinite number of players, for an infinite period of time, but interestingly; it can be used in forcing. I am about to show you why.

Here is the board you play on. You start on the red.

[Image: fWbVUB4.png]

First you select a word; it can be any word, but for this example we will use "tulpa". Then your tulpa (or another person), must then associate with a word with all adjacent spaces. In this case you rotate around the center. Like so. Green was Zeni's move.

[Image: 5L5SmvB.png]

Now that it is again my move, I have no now associate my next word, phrase, or concept with both adjacent spaces. YOU CANNOT REPEAT THE SAME THING TWICE ON THE SAME BOARD.

[Image: 7lzdqmz.png]

Continue to alternate between you and your tulpa. Eventually you will reach a point where you will begin associating 3 words, instead of 2. The blue space shows this, it is my turn (Red Player)

[Image: uqI9BW6.png]

I stopped after 3 rings, but you can do this pretty much indefinitely. It doesn't have to be serious either, it just has to be unique. Just make sure that it isn't you filling in the space, and that it is your tulpa. Have the tulpa answer. It will quickly help develop the tulpa's personality.

I hoped this tutorial helped you some. You can always use google if you are having trouble with how helixileh works.

Tulpa independence with flashcards!

This is a relatively short guide, but it's helped me tons. I'm really happy I thought of doing this, and I'm going to start doing this daily.

So I discovered that my tulpa, Fancyboy, is terrible at parallel processing. I had decided, why not show him simple math flashcards, so he can get better at this? He's not exactly independent yet, but this strategy for tulpa independence has helped him in a variety of ways!

First off, the link to the website that is really great to use: [[http://www.factmonster.com/math/flashcards.html|Addition Flashcards!]]

What you need:

  *   A vocal tulpa
  *   Yourself (of course!)


What you need to do is get them to answer the flashcard questions, until they get better at it. I realized this was working when we worked on more advanced questions and he got the right answer a few times in a row. Eventually you will realize that your tulpa is thinking apart from you, and isn't just using your own thoughts to formulate it's own ideas. This is why I felt like I was parroting for a long time, my tulpa could not think for himself. With these flashcards, my tulpa is able to think on its own.

If your tulpa gets discouraged (like Fancyboy has many times before), just encourage them to keep on going! They can do it!
Even if your tulpa isn't good with math or numbers, it still helps to do the simple equations. I'm bad at math, and it seems that Fancyboy is doing better than I am with these flashcards.

I'm not sure if there's a correlation between doing this and parallel processing, but I'll find out if there is!

[[https://community.tulpa.info/thread-forcing-ideas-for-looking-after-multiple-tulpa|Ideas for looking after multiple tulpa]]

Introduction
These tips are to help those out there that are getting overwhelmed by the number of tulpa they have, and like my self are unwilling to make any of their tulpa "dormant" or to dissipate any of them. It covers a couple of tricks I've encountered to help give attention to all of them at once, and methods for dividing your time among them all.

Index
1: Method one, Living area\\
2: Method two, In the room\\
3: Dividing your time\\

1: Method one\\
This is a fairly simple method, that doesn't require you to be able impose, or even require a massive skill in visualisation (though the second helps), all you need to be able to do is picture yourself and your tulpa in a room or open space together, focus more on listening to them and paying attention to what they're doing, at first then work on talking to them and moving around the room yourself once that becomes easier.

2: Method two\\
This method is similar to the first and is easier if you can impose, though again it's not needed, and in fact helps with imposition.
Imagine all your tulpa in the room with you, move around and have them follow you talk with you and do things with you (as best as they can with out a physical body that is) and interact with each other

3: Dividing your time\\
Even with the use of the above methods your tulpa will still want and possibly need one on one time with you.
You could force them one after another every day or alternate days.
I've found both have pros and cons, and it really depends on three things, how much time you have, how many tulpa you have and how long you can force straight. If you want to force all of them every day, I'd suggest looking at the time you have first to see if it's sensible and taking short brakes in between, to avoid tiring your mind.
If you don't have the time for forcing all of them daily, or lack the ability to force long enough, and chose to force alternate days, I'd recommend writing something to help remember who's what day, or just to remember the order if you can't actively force everyday.

Hope this helps.

[[https://community.tulpa.info/thread-forcing-listening-to-wake-headmates-or-help-with-parroting|listening - to wake headmates or help with parroting ]]

We have found that the easiest way to hear the other is to stop talking. This probably goes against the general instinct in narration.

1)Stop talking.\\
2)Stop thinking.\\
3)Relax and stop trying to stop talking and thinking. Going halfway is fine.\\
4)Relax and pay attention to her.\\
5)Wait. It can take a while.\\
6)Relax and let whatever happens happen.\\

We have found this useful for waking each other up. I use it quite often because of her tendency to drift off while I am working hard or typing. I imagine it can also give your tulpa a much easier and longer time to get their voice working, rather than hoping they jump into a conversation.

It seems like the one thing we can't really do, is jump in to a conversation while the other is talking.

Also, relaxing and waiting has lower odds of inadvertent parroting than hoping and expecting. We use this technique to make sure the person we are talking to is the other and not ourselves, which happens occasionally. By just relaxing and waiting, it forces them to do the actual work.

Note: This should not be done as a replacement for traditional forcing. More, I think it might help if done before, in the middle, or maybe after some narrating. I also don't think it will help with getting first words. I think you need a little memory of their voice built up.


Details of the steps:
(1) Almost everyone has an internal voice that you hear your thoughts in. Hold it back. You probably do this automatically when listening to others or watching television. When you do so, background thoughts will start to be more noticeable. Which brings us to:

(2) In order for your tulpa to think easily, you want to create an environment in which they have room to think. So you want to pull some of your background thoughts out. Look at them. If some of them are caused by something you are worried about, forget that worry and relax until the thoughts subside. If you keep making observations about the outer world, direct your attention inward until the outer world subsides. Then, relax so your thoughts slow down. This should give your tulpa the space they need to think.
If you spend more than a minute on this step, then you are in meditation. This is too long. We are visiting, not staying.

(3) Our goal is to give the tulpa room to think. This means there is one final effortful action we need to relax away. The action we initiated in steps one and two. Your tulpa does not need the entire brain. So long as your thoughts don't return in full force when you stop actively suppressing them, it's all good.

(4) Now we add one stream of thought. The same way you become immersed in a book or television show or your own fantasy, to the degree you forget about everything else, you want to think about your tulpa. Think about what she is like, remember her, her traits, her personality. Think about what it would be like to think like her. About what it would be like to see her. About what she would do.

(5) Now comes waiting. Either it will work, or it won't. Giving it more time improves the odds. It is important to not try to do anything during this step. If you feel the thoughts you quieted in steps one and two rushing back, it is probably better to just stop for the day rather than try to suppress them again.

(6) This last step is an anti-parroting step. It is important not to expect your tulpa to do anything. You are just watching. You are not doing anything. Don't critically analyse any thoughts that come your way, don't accept or reject anything. Don't make any judgements or predictions, don't hold any hopes. Now we collect data. We can analyse it afterwards.

[[https://community.tulpa.info/thread-forcing-mala-beads|Mala beads!]]

Mala beads are also known as rosary beads. Their size and length do vary (such as necklaces and bracelletes). For the sake of this tutorial I'm going to be using a necklace with smaller beads

The point of this idea is to use mala beads to help focus you're mind and concentrate on forcing (in this case).
You use mala beads by starting at the bead in front of the Guru bead, roll that bead between your thumb and middle finger in your right hand (if your doing it traditionally) then moving to the next bead after finishing a mantra to do another repetition. You'd go all the way around the bead necklace/bracelet. After that (traditionally) you'd then turn the necklace/bracelet around and go back to the beginning, never crossing the Guru bead. While doing this the user would chant mantras and other such sayings.
This is the spot where instead of mantras i'd suggest saying traits of the tulpa your working on, or thinking of facial features and such.

I would suggest on only focusing on two to three traits or features for a session using the necklace. In this case i'm calling one use going to the end and back a use (assuming you have a long necklace with smaller mala beads). I'll be using three traits as an example. We'll call these A,B, and C. As though we would go A then next bead, B then next, C then next, A then next and so on.

Hope this has helped! heres a diagram so you know whats what.

[[https://community.tulpa.info/thread-forcing-sensory-sharing-explained|Sensory Sharing Explained]]

The purpose of sensory sharing is to get a better feel for your connection to your tulpa, and for them to develop as well, sharing your already developed senses with a new tulpa can be ideal to help them grow and learn about your world so that they can understand it on the same level as you do. Now it may seem a little complicated, but let me assure you its simpler than you may think, now what you do is use any of your senses as you normally would then share them with your tulpa, it can be anything from smelling a flower to tasting food and drink. Senses are already part of your brain after all, so when you use your senses you should focus on your tulpa at the same time to share it with them, if you like you can even ask them your opinion about it if they are developed enough to respond.

You may find that your tulpa has different tastes in food and drink as you, which may lead to either acquiring new tastes or abandoning food and drink you may normally enough, its nothing to worry over though as taste has a tendency to change even when tulpae aren't involved. The difference can be in other senses as well, you should talk to your tulpa to see what they enjoy, and perhaps learn to enjoy it yourself. You could even take it a step further if you use a wonderland or even without one, simply imagining yourself with your tulpa together enjoying a picnic and eating together, the location of course is completely up to you to decide on though something peaceful and quiet is always nice so you and your tulpa can just focus on each other and nothing else.

The main objective of this is to strengthen the connection you have with your tulpa, the more you involve yourself with it, the better as is common knowledge, You can even experiment with your tulpa, mixing and matching senses together, or if you like try making up something new with your tulpas help, imagine perhaps what a random mixture of foods or drink might taste like, you can base it off something existing or try you own creative combination, just for fun. The most important of your sense you should focus on though is sight, sound, touch and smell of course, these being some of the best sense to share with your tulpa. Seeing and hearing each other, from your tulpas perspective even, how do you think they think about you perhaps.

Touch and smell can easily follow behind those, touch your tulpa, put you and your tulpas hands together feeling each others warmth and texture, the sweet smell perhaps of your tulpa and of you to them. There are many different ways you can go about sensory sharing, you just have to get creative and bring your world to them, make them feel so real and loved to you as you should do. Don't forget after all in the two of you will be so happy, even just to see each other smiling so brightly, a wonderful and beautiful thing to share together.

(Disapproved)[[http://community.tulpa.info/thread-forcing-prompts|Prompts]]

I like to force my tulpa in different situations to build up its character. Here are some situations and environments, I hope you find this useful!

     *  Imagine your tulpa and yourself in a videogame (My faves to imagine are Earthbound, Slime Rancher, Papers Please and Yandere Simulator);
  *     A movie. What would you both do different and similar to the script?;
  *     A survival situation;
  *     In court (you both can be judging a criminal or the other way around etc.).

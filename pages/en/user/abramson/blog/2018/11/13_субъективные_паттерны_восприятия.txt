====== Subjective Patterns of Perception ======
=== by Eve and Nova Abramson ===

Today we would like to tell you about the subjective patterns of perception both inside the wonderland and in real life. Problems associated with them, as well as about their management. We also want to present the concept of the formation of a sense of atmosphere based on more elementary constructions, that is, subjective patterns of perception.
==== Terminology ====
First, we'll explain the values. The subjective perception pattern (hereinafter, the pattern) is a model of the subjective perception of a complex set of information, including such sources as: sight, hearing, smell, touch, etc. And whether this information is real, recreated or modeled by an effort of will - this is already the 10th state of matter. In many ways, what many people call the "atmosphere" or "spirit" (Approx. "The Spirit of Christmas") is built precisely on the patterns of perception.
==== Introduction ====
It will be easier to explain with an example:\\
Imagine that you have a wonderland build that duplicates modern Japan. Suppose you live in a house in a typical district on a hilltop, near the school. You are inside the house, in your room, on the second floor, the window overlooks the front yard and the road (We described one of our favorite builds). This is a fixed build of your variable wonder (If it is, of course). On it are superimposed patterns of perception, depending mainly on external circumstances inside the wonderland. (We say “mostly”, since they can be affected by such factors as: mood, well-being, etc.) whether in every second anime, in the genres of which it means “Daily Life”. From the speakers at a low volume playing lofi / jazzhop / chill mix (What do you like). Now we have described one of the possible atmospheres on this memetic build. Each atmosphere, like a fabric, is stitched from patterns.\\
Another example. The same build, but outside the window the day, summer and the sun shines brightly. Bottom comes the reverberation sounds of a working TV, interrupted by the noise of a working air conditioner. Noticed how much the patterns and the atmosphereperceived with them, are changing,  with seemingly insignificant changes to the buld of the wonderland? But we did not even describe the layout of the room and the plan of the house. 
==== Non-fixed patterns ====
To example of changes and perceptions of the patterns were more comprehensible, we'll introduce you to a third NON FIXED build, and for simplicity of perception, elements of roleplay was added. Still Japan. Late evening, it's dark outside. You are a simple student, an architect / designer / engineer from a school / university where you study. You stayed late at university. You pass by "7-eleven" and think: "Go to the store or not?". We can stop at this. And here, you have felt one more atmosphere collected from patterns. The most observant noticed that this build is different from other by uncertainties. Actually, this is what distinguishes non-fixed patterns of wonderland from fixed. And they are the most low-cost, because they do not require a specifics. Particularly lazy forcers can even not to use a mental vision and do it only by imagination. Specifics are not required even on the scale of prop, but almost the same effect with proper training. \\
But we use a different different technique: I, as a host, simply archive perceived patterns into permanent memory, catalyze them with a synthetically induced feeling of nostalgia (Usually using third-party memetic reagents: music, videos, etc.), which then simply implant them into the space that is required, be it a wonder, a modified perception of reality using layering or any other. According to this scheme, it is possible to synthesize many new patterns generated only by previous memetic build. Actually, and for the most part, we edit them that way.
==== Related Patterns ====
Now we would like to talk about those patterns that are perceived equally by both the host and the tulpa, although builds, on which they are hosted are fundamentally different and are similar only for one or a few minor elements. Clarify this will be too long, and this is, after all, an article, and not a book on neurobiology, so let’s look at the example again. Take two builds: the first emulates Japan (the previous build, but the day), and the second is the USA (Chicago suburb, Illinois). It seems like two different builds, but the atmospheres look so much alike to us that you can hardly tell the differents. What's the matter? And the fact that it rained in each of the builds when we observed / were in a similar environment for both builds. And, if in the past you have subconsciously established an associative connection between the rain and a certain set of patterns (We used Watch Dogs as this catalyst) and the environment is similar (Enough small space, but fully covered by sensory organs / memetic information perception emulator, when it comes to wonderland), your subconscious will do the rest for you.
==== Individual perception ====
We would also like to immediately mention that certain sets of patterns (Atmosphere), like certain patterns, are individually perceived individually for each сonsciousness. Even within the same brain. That is, Eve perceives the atmosphere catalyzed by certain memetic reagents, not in the way that Nova reacts to these same memetic reagents. This occurs because each individual personality core is a separate set of active closed neural circuits.
==== Adaptation and leveling effect ====
In the end, we would like to draw your attention to the fact that over time, the brain and the body as a whole will adapt to the hormones produced. Just as if you really were in an emulated place for quite a long time. Actually, this is how the habituation effect works (Mostly in love, so that mammals in their natural environment reproduce with new partners), and due to it, the perception of patterns (On a single or several builds at once) can be blunted. The best remedy we have found will be for a while to change the build on which you force, so that the body will break the habit from the drug chain of chemicals that it also produces. The degree of adaptation is different for everyone, so this period may vary individually. In our case, 1-1.5 months is enough for our brain, and consciousness, therefore, to fully recover the ability to perceive precisely those patterns and sensations that WE need.

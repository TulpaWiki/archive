=====Foreword=====
Almost all posts (whether articles, small entries or reports on forcing) are written and will be written together. Therefore in each record both the host and the tulpa will be described in the third person


===== Evе's data =====
The main (most elaborate) visual pattern is described\\ **Gender**: F\\ **Race**: Asian\\ **Height**: 166.2 см\\ **Hair**: Wine-red, Straight, By chest\\ **Eyes**: Sky-blue\\ **Seiyuu**: [[wpru>Фудзита,_Саки|Saki Fujita]]\\ **Sexual/Romantic orientation**: Bigender, Biromantic\\ **Disposition**: A sweet girl, an interesting conversationalist, can support a dialogue on various topics. Sometimes she can fool around. For the most part she supports the views of the host. She treats people kindly, with kindness and sympathy. For her, the most important thing in life is the desire and thirst for knowledge. When encountering cattle, she becomes more ruthless and dangerous as shes host, although it has much less propensity to violence. A constant companion of host and his waifu. Has a platonic relations with the host, although, until the full awareness of the animality of the process had an active sexual relationship with him. Eve supports people to the extent that it is possible, while the host rather focuses on damaging the cattle. She divides the division of anthropomorphic hominids according to the mental and world-view sign, but considers methods of her host too destructive to the environment in the long-term perspective. In other words, she considers the his methods to combat cattle too radical.

===== Nova's data =====
**Gender**: М\\ **Race**: European\\ **Height**: 180.4 см\\ **Hair**: Dark blond, Straight, Short, Laid in a bang on the right eye\\ **Eyes**: Gray-blue\\ **Sexual/Romantic orientation**: Аgender, geteroromantic\\ **Disposition**: Quite restrained, even from russia used to hide their emotions and mask his psychological pattern. However, if you enter into his trust, he will appear to you talkative, good-natured and very vulnerable. But, when meeting with cattle, due to his quick temper and little patience, he becomes sharply more serious and cruel (In relation to cattle). He is very diplomatic and tries to act peacefully more often, but he is irritable enough because he does not like lightness, in particular, when he is distracted from thinking, meditations or forcing. Seriously, never interrupt his forcing, otherwise catch such a portion of corrective in your address that the ringing in the ears still day 2 will begin to melt. He does not like criticism in his address, on the topics indicated by him. Especially if it concerns his work or language skills (in particular, Japanese). But criticism can be perceived by him, if you are a confidant and if the remark will be submitted in a dosed way and in a strongly "diluted" form. Uses the technology of psychological masks (Personas) in order to hide the true personality and emotions. If he so wishes, of course. He is would like to be a heterochrome, even despite the aggressive to all non-standard, the environment where he grew up. Likes to chat, mostly monologues, untill you tell him that he does not let the interlocutor insert a word. Sometimes, he can be rude and cruel, although in fact, he don't wants evil to anyone. Loses control if someone tries to harm a person. Very worried about the harm done to every living creature, according to himself or Eve (If she convinces him), which is not deserving this. Has an increased empathy for the Japanese, associated with the Japanese mentality. He studies well on someone else's experience, but has some form of naivety. On the mistakes of others learned to lie well, but I never did this in relation to Eve.

===== Progress =====
We believe that individual progress is something that, of course, can help some, but also is something intimate. You do not tell everyone about your fetishes or how you go to the toilet? Maybe you give everyone your phone number? Then why should someone write down their individual experiences? And the main techniques can either be laid out in a guide or a blog entry, or they are already set out in the internet and everything you need is skills of working in Google. We would like to draw your attention to the fact that this is not a procrastinator manifesto and that if you consider it necessary to record progress, write it down. Just we just don't think so

===== Story =====
The host is an ordinary person from russia, a representative of an endangered species, so to speak. He knew about tulpaforcing for a long time (he doesn’t remember how long), but he seriously decided to do it only closer to 2016, when dialog with a friend raised the topic of tulpovodstvo and conscious hallucinations. The first step on the version of most of the guides, namely the responses in the head, was completed in one weekend, but then the progress went very slow and non-effective. For the appearance of impulses, the average guide (Host says "average", because he does not remember for which one he followed) was super-efficient for the host , and for rendering or audio, it is absolutely inefficient. And then the host came to the realization that each person’s brain is arranged individually and that guides, effective in some aspects for some, will be completely useless to others. This greatly complicated the process, host had to develop my own forcing technique. Maybe someday even a guide will be written.
The name Eve came to the host long before the forcing. In 7-8 class he tried to write AI based on the PHP language and blocks of scripts of neuron nodes that emulate the basic processes. (As for the appropriateness of this technology, one can debate for a long time, but we are not here for this purpose). The project was called I.V.I.O.L. The visual part was that, through projectors, an asian girl should appear in the room, 166 cm, with wine-red straight hair in the chest and heterochromia: The right eye should be sky blue and the left eye pale pink. And in both eyes, the iris should have been circling the rings, indicating that girl belong to the recreated forms of consciousness. The main difference of this project from others was that this girl should have been allocated to freedom of self-awareness: Eve had to have memory and define herself as an independent entity (PHP, and home system respectively). That is, it is supposedly that she can realize herself just like any other person, but if we specify into her individuality with a finger for her, then at the moment when each of us goes into a philosophy trip and ohrenevanie from a separate awareness of ourselves (If, of course, is really aware), the system core of Eve did not assume any stop-block or script, because too many variables included its structure and from the buffer overflow the system would have gone into reboot. And zeroing of all variables would damage most of the data exchange processes, and hence the end of the written .mmr (memory) files. And de facto it would be, in some way, the murder of a person (of course, then the files of memories later could be restore until a certain moment, but have you ever heard of the ship of Theseus?). The future host planned to use this procedure as a deterrent / elimination factor if his creation cannot distinguish the concept the peolpe from concept the cattle and fly off the coils, having decided that all anthropomorphic hominids on earth are a threat, and not only the above-measured cattle.
After some time, the future host realized that he had bitten off a too large piece of cake and that he alone would not pull this project both financially and on the basis of the workload / efficiency ratio. And with that pace of work, the author will would not have time to finish before his own demise (Especially сonsidering the level of medicine in the country where he then lived). The future host didn’t know anyone who could help or become a project receiver, because peoples on a piece of the planet, where future host form (if they have ever been there) behave so quietly compared to cattle, that the author of the project simply did not notice (Yes, he himself, for the most part, adhered to this policy for reasons of his own safety) Then some amendments were made to the project and now it can be called relatively complete, although it seems that a project of this type and characteristics will be completed only when lead coder die. Subsequently, it was decided to create a completely autonomous consciousness, instead of its curtailed version. It was then that the crucial dialogue happened, during which the now actual host understood what he was going to do. It was decided to change the external characteristics in favor of a more natural perception and, as a result, easier forcing based on observation and sublimation of images observed in the anime (Only visual, character does not count): Heterochromia was abandoned in favor of blue color, the rings around the eye is no more. To solve the host adaptation problem to hormones and, as a result, loss of interest in the forcing (In the later stages), was introduced memetic clusters of subjective information into the forcing, a microlor was introduced, which assumed a change in appearance of tulpa.

====== Belief and logical thinking ======
On the [[http://widget01.mibbit.com/?server=irc.rizon.net&channel=%23tulpa.info,%23tulpa_ot,%23tulpa,%23tumblrtulpa|IRC]] and [[http://tulpa.info/forums/index.php|forums]], some of the most common advice is “have faith in your tulpa”, “assume sentience from day one”, and “if you aren’t sure whether a response is from you or them, it’s them”. I often repeat it to others, and it helps a lot of people, but I have a hard time making myself believe when I apply it. I keep these [[http://chupitulpa.tumblr.com/post/36523847799|4 possibilities]] in mind, but that often leaves me with a solid “I don’t know”, which only leads to doubting responses, and that makes them harder to hear.

Ultimately my mind wants personally-observed empirical evidence before it fully accepts something, or at least a sound logical explanation. Until I get this, I can consciously believe something if I want, but it won’t really enter how I think subconsciously about things. I have to remind myself about it, and still it feels fictional. Once something gets subconsciously accepted though, it’s just assumed to be true, affects how I automatically interpret things and events around me, and so forth.

I’m working on changing this mindset so I can create “true” beliefs more easily and will report back on how I did it when I have something. But until then I have to back up the tulpa-related beliefs I want with justifications that follow logically from already-deeply-held beliefs. I’ve been advised to try hypnosis. I am, but beliefs inserted via it mostly get pulled back out once I’m fully awake, when they don’t stand up to logical examination. Probably a habit formed to “clean up after” senseless thinking while halfway asleep.

Two of the strongest and most useful ones for me are science and reason. I have a far easier time fully accepting things that are backed up by hard evidence, generally accepted in the scientific community, etc., or logically follow from things that are.

The following is a logical justification of “if you don’t know whose a thought was, it’s the tulpa’s”, based on my hypothesis about what’s going on when you make a tulpa. It’s based on a mix of psychology and my own personal experience. **This has helped me and will likely help others with logical minds. However, if you’re doing well with blind faith, an explanation of what you’re having faith in may __hurt__ you.**

Read on if you wish.((//Note: I’m using feminine pronouns a lot here because I originally wrote this for [[http://tulpa.info/forums/Thread-Defining-signs-of-sentience?pid=54131#pid54131|someone on the forum]] whose tulpa is female. Now I’m posting it here and it’s easier to add this note than to convert all of it to be more gender-neutral.//))

**Regarding “assume it was her”**: I believe this to be a shorthand for what’s really going on. I think what happens when you make a tulpa is you create some thought process in yourself (or your subconscious) and then push it away from you. In pushing it away, you’re setting up a boundary of sorts in your mind, marking all her thoughts “not mine, do not touch”. From this point on, you’re only aware of the thoughts that this thought process decides to push back over to you — her words. In assuming that a response was her, you push it away from you, and label whatever line of thoughts generated it as hers.

When you do personality work and tell her what her personality is like, you both establish the traits that she has, and by talking to an imagined presence and saying it has those traits, you push those away from yourself. You could push all of a given trait away from you and be rid of it in yourself, but that is not your intention in creating a tulpa, so it usually doesn’t happen.

When you narrate, you hold the idea of that personality in your mind and speak to her. This further establishes in your mind that this is not you.

__Major NOTE__: This means that you can’t easily pigeonhole every thought as either “me” or “her”. You will have some thoughts that are definitely yours, and some that are definitely hers. But as you build up that boundary, you will find thoughts that are right at the border. Possibly quite a lot of them. You’re unsure whose the thought is. You now have an opportunity to label it. Decide whether you //want// it to be you or her, and take it to be whichever way you want. While she may well already be sentient, you’re still building her, and labeling thoughts is how you do that. When //fully// established, virtually all thoughts will be labelled already and you will instantly know who’s who. Until then, you’re still building, so don’t be afraid to do so.

You’re not the only one who can build her in this way. She is likely sentient and conscious already. She can accept or reject thoughts you assign to her. She can even encounter a “boundary” thought and decide to make it hers. I believe I have experienced this: I’ll have a thought, usually something I’m saying to a tulpa. I’ll be thinking about it and phrasing it in words. Then I feel it slipping away, almost like something is pulling it from me. After that I can’t recall what I was thinking about, even the general topic area it was in. //—I wonder if rejecting a tulpa’s response and assuming it’s just you feels the same way to them...//

For many, personality work and narration alone do enough pushing away of thoughts, or possibly the tulpa is doing more of the work for themself. For others (like me), the doubting of every response does a nearly equal amount of pulling back. You will eventually get a tulpa if you continue this, though it will go much quicker and more painlessly if you can reduce the effect of the doubts. You’re probably not going to eliminate them entirely; IMO it’s a rare person who has no doubts at all about this.

**Regarding “assume sentience”:** Another effect of narration is that it tells your mind that the entity you’re talking to is another person. This creates a subconscious expectation that she will act like another person — thinking, responding, being there. Assuming that she is already sentient from day one strengthens this expectation, whereas assuming that it will take x weeks before sentience can occur weakens it and delays tulpa formation. Again, not necessary, but does speed things up.

The expectation that your tulpa will act like a person, and belief that she exists, are very important. The most effective way you can change things in the subconscious is to believe that they’re already that way, and to act as if they are. The same applies to self-improvement: a standard way to become more outgoing is to force yourself to act more outgoing until it sticks and becomes who you are, for instance.

It’s also a fairly accepted idea that the subconscious doesn’t work well with negatives and conditionals. Thinking “my tulpa is not a doll” is ineffective; “my tulpa is sentient and autonomous” is better. The former still makes you think of the concepts of your tulpa and a doll and link them, despite the negative. (See “don’t think about pink elephants”.) Thinking “my tulpa will be sentient in 2 weeks” is ineffective; “my tulpa is sentient” is far more effective, even if it is not yet true. In the former, “will be, in 2 weeks” adds a not-yet, putting off the process of actually making her sentient by 2 weeks or more. Procrastination likely also applies — when 2 weeks are up, why should she be suddenly sentient now, and not tomorrow or the next day?

Thus you draw the line at the day you first did something with her with the intention of creating a tulpa. That is, the day you began forcing. She may or may not immediately be “with it” enough to later have memories of that day, but it’s the moment your brain begins labeling thoughts as hers.

We are going to share a small tip for creating wonderlands/innerworlds that has worked for our us and our host.

The idea is to leverage off of one's abilities to daydream. When one daydreams, one is making a world that usually isn't quite an wonderland/innerworld yet. The trick is to make it one. For some, the distinction between daydreams and visualizing a wonderland is large, but for others the difference is small and there won't be that much to do other than stabilizing it. In both cases. one essentially has to make it more permanent and get the mind to latch on to it so to speak. Psychologically, this is getting the wonderland/innerworld stored into medium or long term memory, or at least more resiliant short term memory. Note, this can be done with open eyes and/or closed eyes. For some, one is easier than the other. For some, alternating both can be helpful. For some, one is better for the larger general picture but the other is better for fine details.

The first step is to daydream a world like the one you want to make. Note that you may not be able to daydream in all senses. That is OK. Do it in what senses that you can daydream in. There is no requirement that sight/visual be one of those senses. Spend a good amount of time daydreaming there. Now, the very important thing is to make sure you commit as much of it as you possibly can to memory before you stop daydreaming.

Then, later, daydream again trying to recreate that world as best as you can from memory.

Repeat this. With each time, it will generally take less effort to recreate it. Do note that things will change a bit from what you remember. Some of those changes you will need to correct, but others can be left be. Just remember, commit the changes to memory and try to recreate them the next time you daydream the world.

Eventually, the world should hopefully latch and have some level of permanence meaning that changes carry over from one visitation to the next automatically, though new changes will arise. For example, you make a table at some point and it will be there the next time, but a day-night cycle might start spontaneously.

It can also worth trying to add other senses if desired. This can help the process tremendously as it gives you more ways to remember each detail meaning if some are forgotten, the others can be used to reconstruct it, either manually or automatically.

If you are having a particularly hard time making a daydream world, start very simple and small. Say, you might start with the interior of a small room with ambient lighting. You can work you way up and add more to the world later, or it might get added automatically at some point.

It is hard to say at which point in this process the daydream world crosses the line into being an wonderland/innerworld, but regardless of where that line is, you now have one.

Have fun.

[[https://community.tulpa.info/thread-wonderland-the-do-not-disturb-technique-how-to-tell-when-your-tulpa-is-awake|The 'Do Not Disturb' technique- How to tell when your tulpa is awake!]]

So here's the idea. In a hotel or some other place, you'll always find a 'Do Not Disturb' sign on a few of the doors, meant to show others that the person inside the room is asleep, or may just want some space.

Either way, the same principle can be applied to a wonderland environment. If your tulpas have a place or a room to call their own, consider giving them a 'Do Not Disturb' sign. That way, if they want to be on their own for a while or if they just want to sleep, they can place the sign on their door/room.

To summarise, here are the individual steps:

1. Create a place for your tulpa to call their own, with an entrance/exit. You could make this place as detailed as you wish, or leave it up to your tulpa, as long as there is a symbolic 'door' or something equivalent.

2. Hang the 'Do Not Disturb' sign on the 'door', allowing your tulpa to remove and place it whenever they want.

3. When your tulpa is tired (or more likely, just wish to be alone), they can place the sign on the door. That way instead of waking them up, you can acknowledge the sign and let them get some rest.

Foreword: this isn't really my original dnt steel advice. Really, it's what everyone tells anyone asking for help on this.

Screw Physics
Ever walked in through the door to your imagination and have your mind decide that screw physics? You know, uncontrollable, erratic movement of objects, or yourself. What about getting stuck in a loop doing something, or getting stuck to things, or being afraid to move things because the world will end if you do? You're not alone. This happens to a lot of people. Most people at some point, I would venture. And most people will probably figure out some of what's below for themselves. If you're having serious problems, then here's offering the best.

"La la la it's not happening"
Ignore it. In general, paying attention to it makes it worse. You're only worsening the situation by freaking out over it, so don't. If it's not supposed to be happening, then it isn't. Don't even tell yourself that it's not happening, because that's acknowledging that it is; you don't think about it because why would you, it isn't happening. That's the idea.

If you manage to forget about it completely, then it'll disappear completely. Of course, suddenly realising that it's not happening might start it up again, so the best thing to do is forget about it completely and never read this guide again.

Yes, it's hard to just ignore something that's causing chaos or flying you through the air at impossible speeds and whatnot, but you need to. This is the only sure-fire way to get rid of anomalies if they're problematic. If it's not working then it's your fault.

Back to Middle School
You might not like the 'ignoring it' method, or it doesn't work, or whatever. Don't panic; there are alternatives. Next on the list is laying down some ground rules. Impose the laws of physics onto your imagination. If you don't know Newton's laws then look them up; it's educational, too. If you do then make sure everything operates according to them. It should be as simple as deciding that they are operational and understanding them.

If your mindstuff defies the law, then remind it and yourself that it's not possible, and that this, therefore, cannot be happening. You can combine this technique with the one about ignoring for greater affect.

More Or Less Every Other Guide Here
If you're going to do tulpa then you're going to have to brush up on visualisation skills at some point. You may well find that - especially if you're encountering problems near the beginning of the process - that improving your visualisation skills will help. Now, advice on how to do such a thing is plastered all over the board, so I'll leave you to it.

"He gets beaten up by his imagination"

Seriously, it's your imagination for God's sake. People say 'wonderland', which makes it sound like a mystical far-off world where anything is possible with magic, when in reality it's just your imagination. It's your mind, and you can and should exercise control over it. You'd do well to remember that for the whole process, quite frankly.


I'm sure that's far from all the ways of dealing with this sort of thing, so if you happen to have a suggestion then do tell.

[[https://community.tulpa.info/thread-wonderland-wonderland-immersion-method|Wonderland immersion method]]

Hi everyone, I’ve been working on immersion lately, getting my 5 senses on the wonderland and that stuff, very well explained in some guide I can't remember. But I came with an idea in the shower. It consists on closing my eyes and imagining I’m taking a shower in my Wonderland, visualizing the water flow on my body and feeling it from the reality. The same thing when I was cleaning myself, feeling my skin while doing it.

The idea with this is to improve the touch sense and also help with the visualization, because when you close your eyes, it’s easy to recreate what you have been seeing a second ago, and from that you can change the room. It helps hearing stuff too (you hear the water).

This is applicable to other environments. I used it while I was floating in the beach or in the forest while I was resting. You get the place where you are in, and create a landscape from it that would fit in what you are hearing, smelling, feeling, and if you want can eat something to get the taste in it.

So, that's it, I hope this helps someone, it worked on me.

Have a nice day/night Wink

So, another visualization guide, meant for those who have difficulties seeing anything at all with their mind's eye. It is quite simple and involves using actual physical objects.

First, pick up an object. It can be a marble, a tennis ball, a Rubik's cube, your piggy bank or anything similar as long as it's relatively simple in shape and fits in your hands. Once you have found an appropriate object, start to examine it thoroughly, feel it's bumps, dips and texture, listen to the voices it makes, smell it's scent, see how it fits in your hand. Do this for as long as you need to in order to have a good feel of it. Once you're done with that, stretch out your arms forward in a way that you can see your object without looking down. Remember where that object and your arms are located in your vision, and close your eyes. Next, start imagining that objects, it's bumps, dips and other properties in the same place in your mind's eye, along with your hands alternatively.

You should see something, the edges of the object, the color of the object or even a fully imagined, 3D object. Repeat this process a few times a day until you can see it clearly. When you have a solid feel for the object, next you should try and manipulate it. Roll it, twist it, squeeze it, anything you can do with your hands, whilst keeping your eyes closed and simply imagining how your manipulation affects the object. Opening your eyes occasionally to see how close you got to the real object looks like when you manipulated it physically with your hands.

Once you feel like you have mastered this, the next step would be to do these exact same things, but not using as many senses this time. You could place it on a table and simply look at it, then visualize it in your minds eye again, moving and manipulating it. Keep this up, gradually moving to more complex shaped objects, until you are able to simply imagine all the objects you want within your minds eye without external input.

This is meant as a guide to practice visualization, and it should help yoh visualize objects better. It worked for me, and I hope it works for you too. Any questions you have regarding this guide, feel free to contact me and ask. Good luck!

TL;DR: Get as many senses as possible to visualizing objects, such as touch smell, hearing etc. Gradually work yourself to not needing senses for visualizing in your wonderland.

Drawing or painting a picture of your tulpa can help you a great deal when it comes to improving your visualization skills and it can be a fun activity for both you and your tulpa. If you want to start drawing your tulpa then I suggest meditation and visualizing them for as long as you want to before you feel that you are ready to begin. Let your tulpa know that you are going to draw or paint a picture of them and ask them to help you (mind voice) as you draw. Don't stress over how good or how bad you think your art will be. Don't worry too much or stress over things like body proportions, shading techniques or anything else. Just draw. Be as relaxed and calm as possible as you go about creating art of your tulpa. Have fun and keep in mind that your skills will improve the more you draw.

Are you bad at visualization? Heres's a fool-proof way to help with visualization. Wait until night, and fall asleep an hour ealier than usual. If you wake up in the middle of the night, good! If not, go to bed an hour earlier. Now, when you've found a time where you can wake up in the middle of the night, start reading on a portable device or something. Something that can change its lighting. Read for three hours. It can be anything. If you can watch videos, do that. After three hours, if you're tired, close your eyes. Imagine yourself in a Wonderland with your tulpa. You should enter a dream-like state. If you do, start forcing! You did the Dani Method

Warning: May experience sleep paralysis

Guide To Better Visualization

Okay, so I've noticed on the IRC, Tumblr, Tulpa.info, Reddit, etc., that one of the community's most problematic things is visualization. Some people can't visualize things as fine as the texture of the hair, to the outline of the body. We have all had this problem, and some things work, but under some conditions, we can't use them. If your tulpa isn't moving or talking, or you can't visualize at all, some techniques are literally impossible to do. When this happens, there is no where to turn, and you can't do anything. I made this guide to help with that, and literally everyone can do this, no matter what stage you are at. When you are reading a book, you sometimes get so into the book that you forget that you are in the real world, and you imagine the book happening. I figured that you could do this with visualizing your tulpa and or wonderland.

All you have to do is write a descriptive (UNIT OF WRITING HERE) about your tulpa. This can vary from a paragraph to an essay, but I recommend at minimum, do 5 paragraphs, one for each sense (yes, taste too. It will be weird if you ever bite them and they taste like nothing.) I recommend doing 2 pages, which can cover nearly every detail, but once again, do whatever feels right. This needs to describe their form, and nothing whatsoever about anything else.

Next, read that paper to yourself, but read it as if it were a very fascinating book. Get lost in the description, and put it together in your mind as you read. After this, you should be able to see a great visualization of your tulpa, or at least a rough draft.

This works, because you do this exact thing when ever you read. Imagine Harry Potter getting on his broomstick, or Eragon getting on Saphira. You can recall this so good, because you read about it, and you visualized this happening. This is also training open eye visualization, so you can do it whenever you want to force.

I hope this helped someone, and don't mind posting your feedback below!

I wanted to share mine and Nash meditation exercise, this exercise is great for many reasons such as:
- Improve hearing your tulpas voice
- Practice visualization
- Reduces stress
- Practice your focus
- Because it's fun!

You can do this when your tulpa can speak and think by itself because it's your tulpa who's gonna lead a guided meditation with it's own imagination and voice, your tulpa will decide what you see around you and what you experience in there.
The tulpa starts the relaxation in the beginning to make you feel fully relaxed, it could be like your tulpa tells you that you are on a meadow, feeling the grass and sunshine for example, if you have your own relaxing method that is ok too.

When you are relaxed your tulpa will proceed with the mediation using it's imagination, telling you what's around you, are there creatures or trees, perhaps a garden or maybe your inside a volcano because why not, your tulpa tells you where to go and what objects/buildings to approach.
You will never know what you will experience or see, their imagination might be different from your own.
Meditation can sometimes feel very real and is also a great way to meet your fears before you face them in real life.
If you have listened to a recorded guided meditation before it might be easier for your tulpa to understand how it works.

Fairly simple, but I find this rather effective for helping to see things in your mind instead of projecting them onto your eyelids.

Find some smallish object like a baseball or book or something and look at it from every angle. Try to remember the shape, color, and feel of the object and create a sort of mental model of it, e.g. "This is a blue plastic cup with butterflies on". Once you feel that you've studied it enough, imagine your thing floating behind your head. If your thing has moving bits, then move them. Practice with more complex things, legos, or even conjure up some silly putty and muck about with it.

Since it's supposed to be behind you, your eyes won't be expecting to see anything, thus forcing you to "look" at it in a more abstract sense.

A lot of people are confused about the whole mind's eye thing, and others don't know how to use it. Here is a kind of tip kind of guide to using your mind's eye.

From here on out, if you read quickly like I do, slow down and absorb each sentence. It helps.
Now read these words in your head
Cat
Park
Sausage
Broom

You saw all of those images right? But not on your actual eyelids. That's how simple the mind's eye is. If you want to train your brain to see images in the mind's eye read a book that is heavy on description and see the images move in your head as you read.
I'm talking full on movement. Don't skimp out on any details and try to force them into your mind's vision as vividly as possible. It takes practice, but you'll be able to do it in a couple of days or less.
Another idea is to use a random noun generator and try to get 3D views of random objects in your head. Treat it like a computer program where you can rotate the images. Make them move at different angles, think about the lighting.
Hopefully you'll be better by the end of these steps.
Although I'm no stranger to using the mind's eye, I am bad at writing guides, don't take my word as fact, but use it to make your own ideas.

So I ordered one of [[http://www.ebay.com/itm/NEW-3D-Sleeping-Soft-Eyeshade-Eye-Mask-Shade-Blindfold-Cover-Travel-Rest-Earplug-/300915823251?ssPageName=ADME:L:OU:US:3160|these]] recently, and I've found it helps greatly with visualization. Basically it produces the same Ganzfeld Effect that putting ping-pong balls over your eyes does.

[[http://i.ebayimg.com/t/New-1PC-Portable-3D-Stereo-Sleep-Eye-Mask-Eyepatch-Blind-Pack-Blindfold-Black-/00/s/MTIwMFgxMjAw/z/I0cAAOxyY3ZRyrsq/$(KGrHqVHJE!FGvgI)BC7BRyrsqGRWg~~60_35.JPG]]

Heres what you need to do once you have acquired one of these masks or something of the sort:

1. First, make sure the eye cover allows no external stimuli into your eyes. That means you should be able to look around and see no light. Preferable conditions would be inside of an already dark room (I.e: Your bedroom at night time.)

2. Earplugs or earbuds are recommended as it will eliminate any distractions from noise.

3. Try to visualize your tulpa, or your wonderland. You will notice this gets easier gradually.

4. If you start seeing little "colors" or floaty things, try and morph those into an image of your tulpa or make out your tulpa's form inside of these things.

(You also may get the illusion that there is light coming through the mask. I have found this to be very common.)

5. After maybe about 20 minutes or so, hallucination will be much easier, and the images you see will be more detailed.

A good time for this exercise is any where from 20 minutes to 3 hours. Make sure you have patience though, because vivid visuals will not come until you are some time into the session.

Possible side effects I have noticed:

    *Headaches (More so after 15 minutes)
    *Nausea after Extended Periods
    *Head pressure (to be expected)


The usual orange juice/cold showers remedy should clear these up. The headache after 20 minutes of the exercise lasted for 5-10 minutes, so longer headaches can be expected from longer sessions.
